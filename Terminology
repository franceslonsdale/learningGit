# Important terminology

TypeScript is a strongly typed language and requires the specification of data types which helps
self document and enforce the code
loosely typed code doesn't require this ie JavaScript

Static typing
Dynamic typing
not the same as strongly and loosely types

Typescript is a staticly typed language therefore types checked at compile time
JavaScript is a dynamically typed language therefore types checked at run time

Pros
- self documenting
- catching errors in development
- great for teams
